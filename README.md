# BlueQuotes - Quote Generator Web App

A minimal, elegant quote generator built with Next.js 15, ShadCN UI, and MagicUI. It shows motivational quotes by category, rendered with a beautiful particle background and interactive UI.

## About The Project

BlueQuotes is a web app that lets users pick from different categories like _inspirational_, _life_, _success_, etc., and displays 3 random quotes from a local array built into the app. The focus is on delivering a clean, fast user experience with custom UI elements and animations using ShadCN and MagicUI.

This was designed to explore how to build fast client-server hybrid apps using the latest Next.js App Router with smooth animations and component-based design.

## Thought Process

- Design custom UI using **Shadcn** for consistency and component reusability.
- Create a custom array in **Next.js** populated with a limited number of motivational quotes across different categories.
- When the user inputs or selects a **specific category**, the app filters and displays **3 random quotes** from that category using a carousel.
